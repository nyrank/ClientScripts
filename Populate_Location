//I created an onChange client script on the caller field for the caller app to auto-populate the location

var loc = g_form.getReference('caller_id');
ah = loc.location;
g_form.setValue('location', ah);


or the server side version would look like this:
current.location = current.variables.requested_for.location.sys_id;
